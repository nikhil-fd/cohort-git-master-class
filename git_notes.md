# VCS (Version Control Sysytem)
- Version control means, we write code in a separate file in 50 line or 100 line or many more. so to track this code like when you modify or replace or insert or delete code such thing controlled by VCS and VCS is made by Git and Git is developed by Linus Torvalds who is owner of Linux Operating Systen and GIT.
### 1️⃣First created a repository/folder for a Project
- Then goto that folder directory through git bash command line.
- Now we need to do version control to this project folder/repository. so use command below,
```git
git init
```
- After use command "git init" then it will initiate/initialize version control to this project folder or file.

### 2️⃣Then all file will become U (means UNTRACKED)
- So we need to do these file TRACKED using below command,
```git
git add filename
```
### 3️⃣hen the file become A (means ACTIVE)
